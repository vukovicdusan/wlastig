        Consulting is there to point you towards those details that might have
        slipped your attention. Or for when you wanna try something you haven’t
        tried before, but aren’t sure how to go about it. Think Google Maps.
        With the right guidance, you’ll get to the goal you set in no time, even
        though you didn’t really know how to get there.

        Consulting takes time. You can’t expect results after a few days or a
        month. (well, in some cases), but if we work together and honour the
        agreement, the results will be visible soon enough.
